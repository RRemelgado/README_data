### Querying remote sensing data in time

<br>

<p align="justify">
In this example, we present the functionality of the function <i>dataQuery()</i>. This function uses and extends upon the <i>extract()</i> function provided by the <i>raster</i> package by allowing the user to search for data in time. This is a predominant issue when connecting movement and remote sensing data. Movement data can be collected with a very high temporal resolution (e.g. minutes, hours) while remote sensing data from open-access sensors is available with a daily resolution, at most. The function allows for an <b>exact</b> or </b>nearest</b> search. So, what are the implications of using each keyword? To demonstrate the difference between both keywords, let's consider the following example data. It consists of movement data from a White Stork and a MODIS NDVI time series.
</p> 

<br>

```R
# read data
shp <- shapefile("./WhiteStork_20150418.shp") # movement data
rs.stack <- stack(list.files('.', '.tif$') # read NDVI data
```

<br>

The movement data was recorded in 2015-04-18. But when are the images from? Letâ€™s extract the dates of the images using their file names. We will need it to inform <i>dataQuery()</i>.

<br>

```R
# function to extract date from file name (in Date format)
sf <- function(x) {
    adate <- (sapply(x, function(x) {substr(strsplit(basename(x), '[.]')[[1]][2], 2, 9)})) # aq. date (1)
    adate <- as.Date(paste0(substr(adate, 1, 4), '-01-01')) + (as.numeric(substr(adate, 5, 8))-1) # aq. date (2)
    return(adate)
}

# apply function (returns a vector of dates)
r.dates <- do.call('c', lapply(vi.ls, sf))
```

<br>

<p align="justify">
At this points, we see that the dates are not in order (figure 1). This is because the data comes from both AQUA and TERRA sensors.

<p align="center"><sub>Figure 1 - R printout showing the order of dates in <i>r.dates</i>.</sub></p>

<br>

<p align="justify">
If this occurs, <i>dataQuery()</i> will not be affected. However, for visualization purposes, lets first order order the stack and the dates.
</p> 

<br>

```R
rs.stack <- rs.stack[[order(r.dates)]]
r.dates <- order(r.dates)
```

<br>

<p align="justify">
Now that our data is properly sorted, let's see plot it. As we can see on figure 2, there are a lot of missing pixels due to cloud cover including pixels were GPS points were recorded. Additionaly, we see that the nearest acquisition date in relation to the tracking date is 2015-04-23 (5 days appart). As a result, if we perform an <b>exact</b> query we will not find any data. This is because this keyword would only extract data if referent to the tracking date (<b>NOTE</b>: For addressing this particular issue see <a href="https://github.com/RRemelgado/README_data/blob/master/rsMove/example_5.md">Point-Based Interpolation</a>). So, what happens when we prompt the keyword <b>nearest</b>?
</p>

<br>

<p align="justify">
The <b>nearest</b> keyword search for the closest data in time to the observation date. As we saw, the nearest date is 2015-04-23. However, as we see in figure 1, this acquisition also contains a few missing values. When this occurs, <i>rsQuery()</i> will consider the next closest acquisition where no missing values were observed. The function will evaluate each pixel separately. to exemplify, let's apply the following code. It queries a query of the <b>nearest</b> image and applies a search radius of 30 days, defined by <b>tb</b>.
</p> 

<br>

```R
query <- dataQuery(xy=shp, img=rs.stack, rt=r.dates, ot=as.Date(shp@data$timestamp), tb=30, type='nearest)
```

<br>

<p align="justify">
The output is a shapefile based on the original xy coordinates (figure 3) containing the extracted values and the date of the image that was used by each point. Looking at the output, we can see that the function required more than one date to provide data for all the coordinates. It used data from 2015-04-07 and from 2015-04-15.

<br>

Until now, we used all the available points to extract NDVI values. However, we should consider that several points have the same value as they fall within the same pixels. To avoid this, we can use the keyword <b>remove.dup</b>. This will evaluate which pixels are covered by the point shapefile and reduces it to unique pixel coordinates (figure 4).
